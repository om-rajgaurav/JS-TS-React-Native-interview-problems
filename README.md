# New Architecture for React Native

1. **JSI (JavaScript Interface)**
   - JSI replaces the bridge, allowing JavaScript to directly interact with native iOS and Android components. This results in smoother and faster performance.

2. **Turbo Modules**
   - Turbo Modules load native modules only when necessary, reducing startup time and memory usage.

3. **Fabric**
   - Fabric optimizes UI rendering, making animations and gestures smoother, updates faster, and the entire process more efficient.
